# A/B Test: Evaluation of a New Payment Mechanism
### üìå Project Overview
In this project, I conduct and analyze the results of an A/B test aimed at evaluating the impact of a new payment mechanism on user behavior.

#### Group A (control group) retained the standard payment flow.

#### Group B (test group) was offered a new payment flow.

### üéØ Goal
To evaluate whether the new payment mechanism positively affects user behavior and decide whether it should be rolled out to all users.

### üìã Input Data
The analysis is based on the following CSV files:

- groups.csv ‚Äî user IDs and their group assignment (A or B);

- active_studs.csv ‚Äî users who were active on the platform during the experiment;

- checks.csv ‚Äî payment data for users during the test period.

### üìä Analysis Steps
1. Data loading, merging, and preprocessing;
2. Choosing main metrics (CR, ARPPU);
3. Creating  dataset with main metrics on which impact of the test can be observed;
4. Using proportion Z-test for identifying statistical effect of changing canversion rate in groups;
5. Checking homoscedasticity in groups' samples;
6. Testing the distribution of user groups for normality;
7. Application of Student's T-test for statistical comparison of ARPPU in groups;
8. Significance assessment;
9. Data visualization;
10. Conclusion and final business recommendation.

### ‚úÖ Conclusion
Based on the obtained data, I can conclude that the new payment mechanism affected revenue, as the ARPPU differs significantly between groups (p-value < 0.05).
However, since the number of payments does not differ statistically between groups, the changes did not impact the share of paying customers.

Despite a similar share of paying customers, the new mechanism increases both revenue and ARPPU.
Therefore, it is recommended to launch the new payment mechanism with the goal of increasing revenue.
